# Capstoneproject-music-player

This is a fully functional and modern React Music Player built as part of my final project submission. The app provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for playing and controlling music, while also implementing important features like dark mode, favorites, and track progress.

It is designed to mimic a real-world music player while keeping the code clean, modular, and easy to maintain.



  Features
	•	Play / Pause / Skip
Users can play, pause, go to the next track, or return to the previous one with smooth controls.
	•	Now Playing Section
Displays album art, track title, artist name, and additional information about the currently selected track.
	•	Dark Mode Toggle
A fully functional dark mode button allows switching between light and dark themes for a better user experience.
	•	Progress Bar
Displays real-time progress of the currently playing track and allows seeking to any point in the song.
	•	Volume Control
A volume slider lets users adjust playback volume easily.
	•	Favorites Section
Users can mark songs as favorites for quick access later.
	•	Responsive UI
Built with TailwindCSS, ensuring the player adapts across different devices and screen sizes.



 Tech Stack
	React → For building the user interface and managing state
	TailwindCSS For modern, responsive, and clean styling
 React Icons For sleek and consistent player controls
	JavaScript (ES6+) → Core logic and interactivity

How It Works
	•	When you select a track, the Now Playing section updates with album art and song details.
	•	The Player component manages the audio element, syncing state for play, pause, volume, and progress.
	•	Dark Mode is controlled via a toggle button in the navbar, updating styles globally.
	•	Users can adjust the progress bar to jump to different parts of the song.
	•	The volume slider directly controls the audio element’s volume.
	•	A list of favorites allows users to save their best tracks.
